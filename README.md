Introduction
-------------

**Roy AI** is a multi-agent based AI project which aims to build a Computational Intelligence and Thinking system with Artificial Consciousness similar to Human thinking. 

RoyAI will try to build a Box-World example using Dilshad Mustafa's Caretaker Theory and Caretaker Software Architecture which is being developed.

A new language called Caretaker Semantic Language (CSL), which is being created as part of this project, and Caretaker Software Architecture (CSA) is used to express Human Memorizing, Learning, Thinking and Hierarchical Thoughts system giving rise to Artificial Consciousness.

> **Objectives:**

> - Build multi-agent based Artificial Intelligence.
> - Develop a Computational Intelligence and Thinking system with Artificial Consciousness similar to Human thinking.
> - Create and invent Caretaker Semantic Language (CSL) to express Human Memorizing, Learning, Thinking and Hierarchical Thoughts system giving rise to Artificial Consciousness.
>  - Develop Caretaker Software Architecture (CSA), a Software Approach with highly scalable Cluster Computing system that can be applied at very large scale and uses existing BigData systems like HDFS, Scality, Akka, Alluxio, HBase, Java, Clojure, etc.
