Introduction
-------------

**Roy AI** is a multi-agent based AI project which aims to build a Computational Intelligence and Thinking system with Artificial Consciousness similar to Human thinking. 

RoyAI will try to build a Box-World example using Dilshad Mustafa's Caretaker Theory for Artificial Intelligence and Consciousness and Caretaker Software Architecture [https://dilshadmustafa.github.io/index.html](https://dilshadmustafa.github.io/index.html) which is being developed.

A new language called Caretaker Semantic Language (CSL), which is being created as part of this project, and Caretaker Software Architecture (CSA) is used to express Human Memorizing, Learning, Thinking and Hierarchical Thoughts system giving rise to Artificial Consciousness.

Complete details of Box World can be found in [https://github.com/dilshadmustafa/RoyAI/blob/master/Docs/BoxWorldDetails.docx](https://github.com/dilshadmustafa/RoyAI/blob/master/Docs/BoxWorldDetails.docx)

> **Objectives:**

> - Build multi-agent based Artificial Intelligence.
> - Develop a Computational Intelligence and Thinking system with Artificial Consciousness similar to Human thinking.
> - Create and invent Caretaker Semantic Language (CSL) to express Human Memorizing, Learning, Thinking and Hierarchical Thoughts system giving rise to Artificial Consciousness.
>  - Develop Caretaker Theory and Caretaker Software Architecture (CSA), a Software Approach with highly scalable Cluster Computing system that can be applied at very large scale and uses existing BigData systems like HDFS, Scality, Akka, Alluxio, HBase, Java, Clojure, TensorFlow, Keras, etc.

## Caretaker Theory And Specific Algorithms ##
A detailed presentation is available in [https://dilshadmustafa.github.io/index.html](https://dilshadmustafa.github.io/index.html) and [https://github.com/dilshadmustafa/dilshadmustafa.github.io/blob/master/Docs/Dilshad_Caretaker_Intelligence_ArtificialConsciousness.pptx](https://github.com/dilshadmustafa/dilshadmustafa.github.io/blob/master/Docs/Dilshad_Caretaker_Intelligence_ArtificialConsciousness.pptx)

> **Caretaker:**

> - There are set of Caretakers.
> - Each Caretaker takes care of one specific area of concern.
> - There might be a few hundred Caretakers. Lets assume 100 Caretakers.

> **Specific Algorithms:**

> - There is no “Master Algorithm”. The issue with “one Master Algorithm to handle all” is its 
very difficult to formulate such algorithm.
> -  Instead of one Master Algorithm there are millions of Specific Algorithms.
> - Each Specific Algorithm does only one specific set of steps.
> - There are Hierarchical Layers of Specific Algorithms. 
> - Specific Algorithms in each layer handle algorithm steps for granularity associated with that 
layer.
> - Each Specific Algorithm Operator/Agent implements one Specific Algorithm at one layer.
> - Focus is on Specific Algorithm (SA) Operator and it's functionality and not on how it is implemented. SA Operators cab be implemented using Neural Networks (Deep RL, CNN, RNN, LSTM, GAN, etc.), Genetic Algorithms, Fuzzy Logic And Fuzzy Reasoning, Expert System or any combination of these or other methods. For an example, we can already find Genetic Algorithms used inplace of compute and memory intensive Backpropagation in Neural Networks in various examples using Open AI Gym.

> **Specific Algorithm Examples:**

> - Try-Record
> - What-To-Try
> - Peek-Classify
> - Ask-WhatWhyWhereWhenHow
> - Answer-Search
> - Do-Action
> - Plan-Ahead
> - Plan-Now
> - React-Hunger
> - React-Pain
> - React-Reward
> - Survive-Danger
> - Address-Failure
> - Address-Success
> - Memory-Store
> - Memory-Recall
> - Memory-Predict
> 
New Specific Algorithms will be added on a need basis.

> **Data Structures In Caretaker Software Architecture:**
1) Column Structures
2) Row Structures
3) Semantic Pointer e.g. (image thumbnail, SHA2 256-bit Address, timestamp)
4) Associative Memory Recall, Content Addressable e.g. (image thumbnail, SHA2 256-bit Address)
5) Similarity Grade Measure e.g. how close a pattern is matching

Column Structure:

1) Column Structure of one or more Trees of Column Structures and Row Structures.

2) Nodes in Trees can be a Column Structure or Row Structure or Neural Network Unit (Deep RL, CNN, RNN, LSTM, GAN, etc.).

3) A Tree can have one or more Nodes.

Row Structure:

1) Row Structure of one or more Trees of Column Structures and Row Structures.

2) Row Structure can connect across Column Structures.

3) Nodes in Trees can be a Column Structure or Row Structure or Neural Network Unit (Deep RL, CNN, RNN, LSTM, GAN, etc.).

4) A Tree can have one or more Nodes.


# Von Neumann Architecture And Brain-like Neuronal Circuits
In Von Neumann Architecture, compute unit, memory and storage are separate. In Brain-like memory-cum-processor Neuronal circuits, a Neural Network does memory store, memory recall and pattern recognition in the same circuit and have Neuroplasticity. Technologies like Neuromorphic processors may address these limitations in current hardware architecture.

We don't have affordable Neuromorphic processors with Neuroplasticity that comes with 100 Billion Neurons and 1 Trillion synaptic connections. With Von Neumann architecture based machines, it takes huge hardware resources and time consuming to train Deep RLs, CNNs, RNNs, etc. for each learnable task. We will approximate them with Clojure rules which provides roughly equivalent functionality. We will use pretrained TensorFlow models wherever suitable.

# Box World
A Box World is a world built with Unicode characters. It allows us to focus on developing Caretaker Theory and to build and test the theory. It reduces complexity involved in training CNNs for visual pattern recognition, NNs for Natural Language Processing, Deep Reinforcement Learning Neural Networks for each and every learnable task in this Box World, which require high compute resources, memory, arrays of GPUs, time and effort.

  

Due to purely hardware resource constraints from my side (lack of compute resources, memory, GPUs, time, etc.), we will use Box World to help with developing and testing Caretaker Theory and to build the world for RoyAI.

  

In Box World, an Actor, denoted by A, can touch/examine/peek an object in the world or to move into the block containing the object to use/consume it.

  

A Box World can be scrollable and in such cases the scrollable side will not have World border characters to indicate that navigation is possible there.

Box World allows User (the Guide) to place things in map interactively and dynamically modify and enhance the environment. User can guide the Actor through a simplified proto-language.
