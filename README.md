Introduction
-------------

**Roy AI** is a multi-agent based AI project which aims to build a Computational Intelligence and Thinking system similar to Human thinking. 

> **Objectives:**

> - Build multi-agent based Artificial Intelligence.
> - Develop a Computational Intelligence and Thinking system with Artificial Consciousness similar to Human thinking.
> - Create and invent Vague Semantic Language (VSL) to express Human Memorizing, Learning, Thinking and Hierarchical Thoughts system giving rise to Artificial Consciousness.
>  - Develop Vague Semantic Architecture (VSA), a Software Approach with highly scalable Cluster Computing system that can be applied at very large scale and uses BigData storage systems like HDFS, Scality, etc.
